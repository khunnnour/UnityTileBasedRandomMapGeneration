# UnityTileBasedRandomMapGeneration
Uses tiles with different types of side connectors to make a map in Unity3D. (Based on wave function collapse)

At this point, it really doesn't actually use wave function collapse I don't think; nor is it particularly developed. Checkout my procedural buildings repo for a cooler version than whatever I was trying to do here.
